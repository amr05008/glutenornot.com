## Summary

Created a comprehensive reference document for completing the iOS App Store submission. This includes all required metadata (app name, subtitle, keywords, descriptions), screenshot guidance, App Store Connect configuration, and a pre-submission checklist.

## Changes

- `mobile/APP_STORE_SUBMISSION.md` - Created new reference document containing:
  - Screenshot requirements and capture instructions
  - Complete app metadata (name, subtitle, keywords, descriptions)
  - App Store Connect configuration values
  - Privacy questionnaire guidance
  - Pre-submission checklist
  - Build commands for preview and production

## Notes

The technical setup (bundle ID, EAS config, privacy policy) was already complete. This document consolidates all the content/marketing requirements for the App Store listing.

Main remaining tasks:
1. Capture 3-5 screenshots on simulator or device
2. Fill in App Store Connect with the metadata from this document
3. Complete Apple's privacy questionnaire
4. Submit for review
