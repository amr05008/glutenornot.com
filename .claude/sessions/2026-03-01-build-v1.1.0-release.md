## Summary
Bumped version from 1.0.4 to 1.1.0, ran expo prebuild, applied post-prebuild version fixes, ran pod install, archived and distributed via Xcode.

## Changes
- `mobile/app.json` — version bumped to `1.1.0`
- `mobile/ios/GlutenOrNot.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — both `MARKETING_VERSION` entries fixed from `1.0` → `1.1.0` (prebuild quirk)
- `mobile/ios/GlutenOrNot/Info.plist` — `CFBundleShortVersionString` was correctly set to `1.1.0` by prebuild this time (no manual fix needed); `CFBundleVersion = 1`

## Decisions
- `CFBundleVersion` left at `1` (reset for new marketing version)

## Notes
- Prebuild set `MARKETING_VERSION = 1.0` (drops patch segment) — still needs manual fix each time
- Info.plist was correct this time (previously also needed manual fix)
- CocoaPods path issue: prebuild couldn't find `/opt/homebrew/bin/pod` — ran `pod install` manually after accepting Xcode license with `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`
- Xcode license acceptance was required this time (new Xcode version)
